## 2026-11-08 15:30 — P0 — scaffold, local services, database layer
Done: installed local tools (pnpm, gh, Docker CLI link); P0 tasks 1–4 (skills check, Next 16 scaffold, Docker Compose + .env.example, Drizzle schema + migrations + test DB); HUMAN_TASKS steps for all tasks.
Commits: 6ea39b8 cf1b6f4 48372c7 fcc766f c356520
Tests: pnpm check ✅ (3 tests), pnpm build ✅, pnpm e2e smoke ✅ 4/4 projects, drizzle-kit check ✅
Left off: P0 task 5 (auth) — config skeleton in src/server/auth/auth.ts; next Argon2id hashing, mfaVerified session hook, authz policies, sign-in pages.
Notes: run `pnpm services:up` before `pnpm test`; local .env.local generated with random secrets (share via H-02).

## 2026-11-08 16:30 — P0 — checkpoint: auth + authz harness done (6/15)
Done: P0 task 5 (Better Auth server: Argon2id, mfaVerified session flag, authz policies, action template; sign-in UI for customers + staff TOTP enrolment; dev outbox) and task 6 (authz matrix harness, coverage guard, setFeatureFlag + audit/flags services).
Commits: 37e4068 9e7b01f 0593a34
Tests: pnpm check ✅ 136 tests; pnpm e2e ✅ 12/12 on 4 projects; pnpm build ✅; mutation check showed the matrix catches a removed MFA rule.
Left off: start P0 task 7 — design tokens (src/styles/tokens.css per DESIGN §3), Fraunces + Manrope via next/font, Tailwind theme, reduced-motion handling; then restyle auth pages with the primitives in task 8.
Notes: `pnpm services:up` before tests. Never pipe `pnpm check` into grep before `&&` commit (hides failures). Forms: uncontrolled + useHydrated (see DECISIONS).

## 2026-11-08 18:00 — P0 — checkpoint: tokens + UI primitives done (8/15)
Done: P0 task 7 (tokens, fonts, Tailwind theme, reduced motion, contrast test) and task 8 (UI primitives + /dev/ui gallery, component tests, axe + overflow E2E). New standing rule in CLAUDE.md §1: push after every task, soft `task` sound, stop for review every 3–5 tasks and at phase end with the `review` sound.
Commits: fbeace3 f92b32f
Tests: pnpm check ✅ 170 tests; gallery E2E ✅ 4/4 projects (axe clean, no overflow); pnpm build ✅
Left off: start P0 task 9 — motion primitives (View Transitions wrapper + fallback, press feedback, Sheet/Modal/SidePanel, skeletons) and `/dev/motion`. Load `emil-design-eng` + `mobile-native`; run `review-animations` on the diff.
Notes: Testing Library cleanup is explicit in tests/setup.ts (globals off). Grid items holding truncating text need `min-w-0`. ink-3 is never for readable text.
