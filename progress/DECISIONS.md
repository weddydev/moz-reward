# DECISIONS — architecture and trade-off log

Newest first. 2–4 lines each: date, decision, why, consequence. Includes accepted budget overruns (CLAUDE.md §3) and new runtime dependencies.

Template:

```
## YYYY-MM-DD — <short title>
Decision: …
Why: …
Consequence / revisit when: …
```

---

## (kickoff) — Agent skills and working rules
Decision: Install only four Emil Kowalski skills (emil-design-eng, animation-performance, mobile-native, review-animations). Adopt root-cause debugging and verification-before-done as CLAUDE.md rules instead of installing the full Superpowers plugin. Not used: Ponytail, UI UX Pro Max, Graphify (revisit around P3 if search becomes slow), Gatekeeper, OmniRoute.
Why: motion quality is a core requirement; the full Superpowers workflow adds approval gates and token cost that conflict with phase-based autopilot; UI UX Pro Max would override the chosen design direction; Ponytail's minimalism conflicts with the premium UI spec; OmniRoute routes client code through third-party providers.
Consequence: DESIGN.md §8 signature moments are documented exceptions to the skills' sub-300ms rule.

## (kickoff) — Initial stack
Decision: Next.js App Router + TypeScript, Drizzle + Postgres (PostGIS), Better Auth, Redis + BullMQ, SSE, Cloudflare R2, Web Push, Bubblewrap TWA for Android. No iOS App Store build.
Why: one codebase for three portals, low running costs, free tiers available, no vendor lock-in for realtime.
Consequence: record exact versions here after scaffolding.
